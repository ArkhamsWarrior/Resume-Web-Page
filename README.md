# Resume-Web-Page

This is a project that came to mind in one of TraversyMedia's videos for establishing a portfolio. I think this will be a good way of challenging myself to compose a site
with the many HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP knowledge that i've obtained thus far.

I have a very simple layout together at the moment, but I want to make sure that my page will be:
- Responsive
- Interactive
- Comprehensive
- Intriguing
- Different

I would like for this page to be the forefront of what I can do with the web technologies I've learned and helping me in my progression for newer web technologies such as 
React, Angular, Node.JS, MongoDB, etc. 

Some ideas that've come to mind when brainstorming for this page:
1. Hover and reveal information (Such as personal information that are made into bullets)
2. ~~Progress Bar with the sections of the resume instead of a nav bar (Progress bar would be a fixed element on the left. Will this obstruct the layout of the page though?)~~ **!!Completed!!**

3. Flash effects when hovering over bullets in the "Technologies" section, along with lightning bolts being the list-style-image for the bullets
4. PHP that asks if my qualifications met the employer's satisfaction. (Just a first idea. I would like to maybe establish a domain for my site and an email that will retrieve
the responses, or atleast send me an email that someone has submitted a response).
5. Have the different sections of the page fade in and transition upward as you progress, and fade out and transition up as you scroll away from them. (I enjoy
having that smooth aesthetic in a page)
6. Attach a download to my .docx resume on the webpage.
